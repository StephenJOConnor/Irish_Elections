# Irish_Elections

Uses scrapy, selenium, numpy, and pandas to scrape and transform Irish election data from http://www.irelandelection.com/. 

The Irish voting system is single transferable voting (STV), a form of optional preferential voting (OPV) that produces significantly 
more data per voter than the ubiquitous "first past the post" voting system. Till now, voter transfers were not recorded centrally, precluding in-depth data analysis. The web-scraping and data transformation carried out here is the first step in gaining valuable past voter and future voter insights.
